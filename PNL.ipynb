the world ve lived in san francisco for years and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits lots of great friends and acquaintances which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site but m feeling like meeting some new people that aren just friends of friends it okay if you are friend of friend too chances are if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions lifestyle statistics photo scanning and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result you are probably already cultural peer and at most people removed at first thought should say as little as possible here to avoid you but that seems silly as far as culture goes m definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum but don exactly wear it on my sleeve once you get me talking it will probably become increasingly apparent that while d like to think of myself as just like everybody else and by some definition certainly am most people don see me that way that fine with me most of the people find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves you probably are too make nerdy software for musicians artists and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness but like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication than with visual form objects or technology also record and deejay dance noise pop and experimental music most of which electronic or at least studio based besides these relatively ego driven activities ve been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death improvising in different contexts alternating between being present and decidedly outside of moment or trying to hold both at

body language often performed in caricature or large gestures if not outright interpretive dance dry dark and raunchy humor my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people comment on the most when sufficiently stimulated have an unmistakable cackle of laugh after that it goes in more directions than care to describe right now maybe ll come back to this okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific it like being in the crosshairs for what it worth find myself reading more non fiction than fiction it usually some kind of philosophy art or science text by silly authors such as ranciere de certeau bataille baudrillard butler stein arendt nietzche zizek etc ll often throw in some weird new age or pop psychology book in the mix as well as for fiction enjoy what little ve

to think am good at communicating making friends understanding people making people feel appreciated making them smile when they are feeling down sharing my happiness and physical displays of affection and love it hasn always been this way but ve worked to develop these skills and think it paid off wear funny shirts they have funny and or insightful quotes and or images on them that what people used to notice but haven heard that in while nowadays people mostly notice have beard maybe should shave it so people will look at the rest of me again as an aside think this question is best written by other people so if you have any suggestions for what this part should say please do not hesitate to tell me books almost anything fantasy the lord of the rings tolkien the wheel of time sadly robert jordan passed away before completing it the death gate cycle weis hickman memory sorrow and thorn tad williams riftwar legacy raymond feist also the da vinci code dan brown movies avatar dark city the game inception monty python and the quest for the holy grail memento pay it forward ghost in the shell and inside man also like cartoons watching them and being enchanted by them feels

lived extensive periods without these sometimes lacking all of them at the same time so obviously can do without them but these things are so central to my life that missing one makes me feel incomplete life the universe and everything me my friends and everyone else programming politics and philosophy the past the present and the future think and fret lot care and thus think about fairness the environment animal rights and programming languages my dream is to one day create programming language that is suitable for interactive use and for writing large projects and which is safer in terms of mistakes one can make and more flexible or powerful than languages in common use today have it all but figured out doing the same thing do every night in my case that not taking over the world but trying to make my world better place which will hopefully improve it for other people as well for example maintain website http inglorion net with essays about things feel people should know and links to pages that feel deserve more attention hmm so you want to know my little secret ey well believe that especially in relationships the problem is often too little openness so am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible and sooner rather than later there are really only reasons keep secrets because they involve other people unless know they are ok with it try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private because want to keep it for later for example am not going to tell you what is in your present until you ve opened it as for all the weird and wonderful things haven told you yet if you are interested send me message and start discovering you should message me if well if you feel like it really there is no reason not to really unless you re really not interested in me at all love to get messages from people some reasons you might want to message me in no particular order you live near me and would like to meet up like making new friends checked out your profile but didn write you message this probably means intended to write to you but lacked the time or was too tired working full time makes me that way you found something on

and although it too big for anyone to see in entirely you re excited to try you re looking for someone like me who shares that energy that curiosity that lust for life that burns inside you because adventures are often more fun when shared with others you live your life out of the mainstream but not averse to jumping in every now and then to see what the rest of the kids are doing you think about everything from morality to the nature of reality and have your own views on topics instead of blindly following social conventions you have made mistakes in your life you learn from them and move on you are beautiful inside and out not in the stuart smalley m good enough and m smart enough and gosh darnit people like me way you know from the depth of your being that you are an amazing

intelligent creative interesting physically fit people like yourself who doesn occasionally get intimidated in that company you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body you are very sensual being human touch is very important hugs kisses massage and sex people skirt around the topic of sex all the time but lets face it sex is very important aspect of relationship for someone like you or me and there no point wasting our time in situation where the sex is less than phenominal m excited to hear about your turn ons and fantasies money is not really an issue for you not because you re obscenely rich that not really important just mean that you have no trouble making the life you want for yourself you appreciate that we are very gifted fortunate people to live as we do you give back

snowshoeing telemark snowboarding road biking swimming tai chi qigong and yoga all sound interesting to you even though you haven tried them all yet maybe you won even like all of them but at least you re excited to give them all try you are not serial monogomist you are independent and comfortable being alone it fun to date and meet new people but you re not going to settle for anything less than you deserve ultimately you crave relationship you can commit to for the rest of your life you are looking for loving relationship based on good communication and trust eventually you might want

to try out around the city and revising mental maps of where d like to end up eventually love hunting for just the right vintage pieces naturally m an etsy whore and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores especially the alameda county antique fairs my most recent vintage purchase was gorgeous grundig majestic record console do believe it my favourite piece of furniture own now like trying out cozy new places to eat and new recipes but m not by any stretch of the mind foodie frequent wine bars and coffee shops bay area staples love the beach totally appreciate being relatively close to the beach after having lived in ny where the beach was neither close to the city nor worthwhile like finding fun new ways of being active like finding new trails to jog paths to bike or walls to climb going on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do and fun way to get to know people love all things creative so art walks gallery openings live performances museums activities that involve creating art are all places that tend to gravitate towards and m always looking for more people to that are also into these kinds of events m into technology particularly mobile which is the industry work in it a long story as to how got here but it where want to be and actually don hate my job tweet and facebook and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the current goings on with the latest gadgets but also read magazines like juxtapoz big up etc because love them and for the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up when it comes to friends m super loyal and think respect is important bad communication in any relationship friendship or otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion and personal pet peeve of mine like to be as up front as possible in most situations even if that not what the person wants to hear eventually d love to settle down with someone who really enjoy respect and feel strong connection with ideally d

spend time and get to know them m cuddler and hand holder and just because er and likely professional grade spooner although dating wise this past year has been very mismatched for me as it seems that

just rush into things and pow have everything be like fireworks display and then think they tend to fizzle out just as fast so m just open to friendship right now previous guess m just not in the mood of talking myself up and would rather just get to know someone and listen to them talk about themselves and let them get to know me in way that has more natural flow this doesn mean can hold conversation it just means that sometimes wish could wave magic wand and have my soulmate here beside me m saying this somewhat facetiously because really don think believe in the idea of soulmate even if was with person for years and they god forbid passed away would still want to believe that there was another love out there for me yes that is thinking bit too far in the future but m working on trying to live more in the moment lol would like to meet someone that is open minded without being super liberal and crazy the current definition of open minded is sort of free for all and don view it that way would say m more of moderately conservative person in some ways but definitely have my wild and spontaneous side m bay area native currently living in the east bay but originally from the city m in the technical field who isn but am currently considering return to school for masters degree and career change have two teenage sons and love them dearly but once they re grown and gone it gonna be all about me lol they don need dad but someone that is teen friendly would be welcome addition to my life anyway back to the soulmate thing sometimes you just meet someone and everything is so easy and just falls into place effortlessly the problem with that is sometimes it so easy you forget to view the red flags and warning signs would like to meet someone and keep my eyes open but still have the pieces fit together like that m not person that really has favorites there are few categories of things movies for example where do have some favorites but overall might have consuming interest in something one year and the next year ll be on to something else definitely don have favorite song or color or day of the week or anything like that this makes me more flexible to be open minded as to my partner interests but have enough things that interest me and enough life long friends that won try to lose myself in the other person life but still have my own interests as well wouldn want to be with someone that requires so much alone time though that we don have enough time together okay that was rambling but hope ve said little about myself at least to give you an idea of if not who am then who would like to be with lol some interests reading spoken word poetry hearing comedy shows live music hanging out with friends and family going to the movies surfing the net travel am awake aware and significant spending far too much time trying to tactfully tell people that the word they are looking for is converse and not conversate spelling listening learning if they met me on the internet first it usually that my pics don do me justice seriously ve heard that few times in person my smile or my birthmark depends on the person guess can give you genres but m not person that has true favorites something may be my favorite at the time and then may not be able to recall the title or author at later date books most sci fi although fantasy not so much stephen king will read non fiction g self help occasionally urban fiction movies everything with the exception of that goofy slapstick type comedy and no extreme horror music like music like going to see live music like dancing sometimes don love music like have to hear it daily or it has to be on whenever m in the car and don really have too many favorite artists or bands guess like mostly neo soul old school b gospel christian and other as far as genres listen to most often by other mean that like random songs from probably almost every genre of music except death metal or something like that food m adventurous when it comes to food although really have never liked most morrocan or indian foods and rarely if ever eat pork like some italian dishes but not huge fan of pasta other than that m open to all types like ethiopian other african foods thai etc god family friends affection passion books iphone and have to add in my dvr everything think have add my mind thinks about all kinds of different things all the time have to tell it to be quiet lately ve been at home gasp lazing around watching tv or being on the internet have been reading more lately again when read book devour it can stand to put it down and have to read it all the way to the end even if stay up until the wee hours of the night go through phases sometimes m running around all over the place doing this doing that never being home and then other times it like im in hibernation mode right now m hibernating and occasionally break free actually watch the mindless entertainment we call television sometimes and it makes me laugh don have to say watch it on hulu or online so that m different from the rest of the sheep either lol you would like to get to know me better you re single and available you re easy

our mood energy level life experience and general disposition and my default switch is usually set at funky rhythms enjoy profoundly entrancing melodies from mozart brahms rachmaninov etc as well as wide variety of ethereal melodic down tempo music when in the proper space and mood but typically just happen to be in more head bobin toe tappin booty shakin mood some staple genres include but are not limited to funk soul rock blues punk ska jazz breakbeats drum bass hip hop glitch hop trip hop future bass jazzy house and funky disco house food yummy healthy air water food friends family trust

that work out between us and understand that sometimes things just don quite go as planned so you re late or you have to cancel something or you re grumpy in the mornings so what take everyone with grain of salt and don tend to take anything too seriously like to see people care about as often as can but whether that translates to once month or twice week is fine some people are busy some aren live your life how you want to and ll be happy if we can do so together might really love spending time with you but m not going to hold it against you if you re working on hour week likewise don want

height but then should be making k as well so what the hell m in transition changing career paths from database administration to data analysis working on getting better qualified for consulting analyst positions for now my lackluster cover letters or my terrible resume no one really knows have so far kept me cheerfully tuning queries tables instead on personal level m mostly trying to pull it all together build coherent practice be better friend to people care about by replying to their messages more often and more promptly by being on time more often be more organized effective in my life keep everything filed up to date keep my personal space more tidy than not it a process m always working on something some aspect of me that feel can improve have very high standards for me even as don expect too much from others and sometimes feel like every time get everything dealt with something else pops up that never noticed before maybe it a refining process and m dealing with it all sequentially but doubt it think m just human doing my best to do good job at living my life for business career self improvement m teaching myself to use couple of statistical packages reading textbooks on business process optimization theory bring it on nerds and to help make my inside vision match my outside world read psychology behavioral economics books mostly popular mass market

at separating essential from inessential once got to the airport without passport because was too focused on which wallet it went in allowing enough time for contingencies and emergencies m working on

excessive or semi irrelevant detail essential inessential it time for the end of this sentence an off beat sense of humor an overall sense of relaxed composure wry smile and my excellent dress sense if by excellent it is understood that mean encompassing the well bred gentleman ideals of bespoke suits cut and blended with s loungewear and occasionally clothes from the s that are clearly cruel joke perpetrated on an unsuspecting and unfashionable public why you might ask why on earth do you ever willingly knowingly wear polyester because you can wear clothes that even retired color blind golfer in florida would find embarrassing without bringing feeling into the room that maybe more fun should be being had right now maybe you have to be there but it true although you wouldn find this out for while after we met if we met because find the opposite effect to be in force in casual first encounters it just too hard to get past the plaid regardless of what people notice they often like me for no apparent reason pretty much right off the bat maybe there are factors neither nor they are aware of but it usually seems like people like me basically just because m there it almost weird except that just how it is my current theory is that make people feel good about themselves because m very non judgmental and because see the good parts first and the bad parts often only much later thus seeing themselves reflected as though through glass brightly perhaps they think to themselves who is this jovial fellow this man amongst men this keen eyed rogue who sees me as the princely soul am really have got to do something about the parentheticals footnotes would look stupid so clearly drastic cuts are in order for now suck it up until fix it wiki edit it or send me hate mail about how terrible it is ll be impressed you read this far down the page either way well done you there will be quiz at the bottom like to read mind bending fiction g philip dick some borges even huxley that takes you to another mental place entirely ll watch any movie that makes me feel different after ve seen it and ll eat just about anything not beets love their flavor but it would seem that m allergic to them think exorcist or actually don specifically love southern food in all its incarnations especially collards beans gumbo like fried cheese it sounds terrible know but it actually good for you if you fry it in grapeseed oil because it better for you than cheese fat frying the cheese sort of clarifies it plus it delicious if you crisp the cheese on the outside serve it on crostini with tomato salsa and all sorts of things that aren supposed to be very good for you no junk food though processed foods never taste or feel that good to me could eat roast vegetables every day and fried collard greens with bacon peppers five times week the last movies saw in theater were mulholland drive don judge me it was retrospective which still find to be quite thought provoking and john carter which enjoyed largely because the d was excellent because m long time fan of edgar rice burroughs it doesn belong in films but m so exceedingly amused by the venture brothers series on adult swim that m putting it here anyway would date someone solely because they liked watching the venture brothers and futurama with me although don know how long that would last about seventy episodes guess don have favorite music just music that listen to lot at given time once start listening to an artist or genre get everything can in that vein and listen it to death or until something else catches my fancy at the moment it led zeppelin crossed with bootleg live fatboy slim aphex twin mixes ambient dub and noise that last is new m not really feeling it yet but it comes recommended so m giving it time also like grime uk dubstep imports but as say that realize it getting harder harder to find good dubstep as there so much tat put out by labels who are capitalizing on stereotype of the sound but not really encapsulating the feeling parenthetical remarks judging by the above as samples the company and contact of people like kisses touching etc exercise fresh air and change of scenery options hate being boxed in sunscreen most of the time time to think reflect or to feel respond to the moment does anyone count these six things message or im me if someone has ever corrected your seven list or grammar or punctuation m just curious because sometimes get the urge to fix someone comma splices or obvious misspellings and malaprops but then think to myself that if it mattered to them they run the spellchecker before submitting it and then m just the fastidious idiot fussing over nothing neurological functions synapse repair proliferation neurotransmitter pathways how to make my brain work better smarter what m going to do with the rest of my life what want to do for money where want to be physically otherwise in years how to live in such way that when look back at m happy with my choices now or rather not thinking about now but being in it swing dancing at ballroom or at bar or show with friends don tend to drink much but tend to like hanging out with people who do go figure so it works out well enough anyway as an aside m amused at how many people won admit to having typical friday night to write about at certain level think it bespeaks little bit of denial that you re as knowable as everyone else or perhaps lack of self knowledge self examination if you can look back recognize your patterns contrariwise if you truly have no patterns that is in itself little odd to me don mind if your pattern is go out do something that ve never done before or even write numbered list of the top results from google search of sf activities this weekend and then roll sided die but suspect if you actually look at your life there probably is pattern maybe m being too literal here ahem get along really well with people who are many kinds of high though tend to be almost straightedge why is this private several times have found myself at party where know couple of people but seem to get along really really well with everyone they seem to be lot more like me than most people are more friendly talkative and upbeat than usual and less rigid self absorbed or uptight and have thought to myself these are my people feel at home with these people like just another one of many rather than someone who is always little bit different when it becomes clear later either because someone makes it obvious or perhaps party goer later mentions that the reason why people seemed different that night from how they have been since is because just about everyone else was high before got there it makes me wonder if think those folks are like me what am like in the end though realize it just thing have to come to terms with like so many of you reading this am just little bit different from most people we re all unique individuals certainly and although some of us may seem to be bit more unique for some reason the fact remains that this is the life you have and your best option is to live it as well as you can so be it you think you re smart interesting heartful curious or fun to spend an afternoon with m looking to expand my circle of people that connect really well with or even just find more folks who like to do new things have more fun than they probably should according to their more boring friends admit as you ll know if you ve read the foregoing m not short of friends people m currently not sending postcards to or calling so if we don get along pretty well pretty quickly then it might not work out but reckon it worth coffee or cocoa to find out also please message me if you have any suggestions for books or music either because you think d like them for some reason or because you think so highly of something that you reckon everyone should take gander at it double bonus if you can give precis of content in fact d be really impressed m still working on that for my own reference helps me remember themes details outcomes lastly please don be offended if you im or message me and it a little while before get back to you for one thing see above re responding to mail but also have firefox okc plugin so it looks like m online all the time regardless of where am m probably not ignoring you m just not there ',\n",

actually reading this that means that you might want little insight into who am or where got that badass birthday mug think it pretty hard to get to know someone just by reading few paragraphs they wrote about themselves most likely after few drinks firmly believe in the power of chemistry and the way certain people click and others just don i merely suggesting you don judge someone by these

outdoor stuff m not quite as into it as the next guy but for good reason see below don get me wrong m totally up for doing that kind of thing with the right person just last month someone got me climbing the stanford dish love camping even though haven been in long time it just the hiking and climbing stuff that is tough for me to handle again see below to be honest d much rather just chill out cuddle and watch movie maybe get drunk and watch cartoons or maybe play chess or poker or jenga m always up for going out but do love good quiet night at home right now m pretty much just working

this weird color thing where my converse all stars have to match the rest of my clothes in some fashion no pun intended can probably name that movie or actor you can remember or the voice on that car commercial that you just can place have this odd talent of simplifing complex ideas to make them easier to understand this means can teach almost anyone almost anything as long as understand it had this all filled out with specific books shows movies etc but really isn that what getting to know someone is about like lot and if it well writen acted performed and makes me feel feelings ll probably

for the right man in fact it a high priority for me to make time for great man and create great relationship together my spiritual life is quite significant but the form is not rigid m happier hiking gardening singing kirtan and bhajans or going to yoga class all of those are spiritual for me than going to church or temple although can enjoy that too on occasion my orientation to life is spiritual has been my entire life and is well integrated into my being so it not critical for me to do spiritual things m quite self sufficient but much prefer partnership ve gone from being super competent ultra independent feminist do everything myself to being able to kindly ask for help graciously accept it when it offered and be feminine participant in the relationship m very generous with the many

unconditionally and appreciate another fully our chances for really harmonious relationship increase tremendously if the same is true for you while having shared interests is nice what is more

creative types but center on building connections this is my second account on this site as saw significant changes in my outlook on life relish in the fact that can take opportunities to rediscover myself the main reason have come to like this site is the possibilities or potential to connect with someone unless you live in the bay area or are planning to have little time to develop or devote to someone have no chance of seeing face to face unless they give some compelling reason that would include but not limit things that pertain to what is on my profile here will quiz you on what is contained here believe in connection it is more important than anything and have passion about it am extremely serious about this if you want to ask me about this be prepared for long response have boundaries and abide by them the next thing that is very important is that ignore people who do not have match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages take some time to fill out few of the questions and profile thanks am intense positive and artistic seem to have difficulty finding work that will not just give empty promises am learning about reconnecting with myself and those who are of similar mind of late have considered what it means to be me in greater sense this is another reason am on this and other sites if you get message or comment from me it is likely that have found connection point with you always looking for those who can understand what dreaming really is testing the limits of sane and safe behavior in the insane world we all have created watching my daughter drive everyone crazy finding the humor in just about everything about me enjoying the new connections in my life and living them to the fullest telling the people who are important to me that they are loved teaching my daughter how to recognize the limits that humans have to deal with on regular basis coping with the moments as they come to me finishing the questions on this site and hoping that some good friends come out of it will also send message to those that message me being one with the universe thinking on changes that are happening to my life trying to see things as they really are not what they seem to be listening for the little things that add up to the bigger ones listening to the soul of things as see it trying to make connections with others being in the right place foot rubs also seem to have the ability hold people attention without even trying sometimes noticing people who notice things around them getting the trust of complete strangers touching the soul of others pushing the limits of creativity my eyes or my hair have very intense eyes that people say look right through things the other thing is that sometimes seem really tall the intensity is what usually gets most people my intensity is shown in just about all of me welcome your messages to tell me what you see occasionally color my hair to help thin it and keep the white at bay for the moment my hair is longer now and still very thick have love of hair that borders on fetish the longer the better apparently the color of my hair is very interesting topic for the moment books have deep love of just about anything by isaac asimov robert heinlein is also up there have been reading science fictionsince years old ray bradbury is really good too neil gaiman is probably my favorite now think am starting to like terry brooks as well have lot of books about the stuff that am interested in and am trying to find way to compose my own philip pullman is on the list too just realized that s lewis is also big on my reading list have large collection of supernatural beings in my collection yes even some old d novels are in there everyone has their fluff to read friday by robert heinlein aisling by louise cooper lion blood by steven barnes harry potter dracula by bram stoker unabridged beowulf and more to name later the black dagger brotherhood books by r ward are interesting movies beowulf adapted by gaiman the lord of the rings rotk the extended version filled my nights with pondering music have always liked what is now called classic rock though when it comes to playing or composing tend to be more blues oriented have thing for percussion of all types largely depends on what my mood is at the time have over thousand cd in my collection have just about every kind of music what is there not to like save for the stuff that puts people down as long as it takes you someplace it is very welcome of late though am starting to drift back into darker mood to the music listen to for the moment my youtube account has good representation music means lot to me angus young henry rollins danny elfman jimi hendrix colin hays joan jett robert johnson tenacious concrete blonde howard jones metallica kmfdm lycia estampie rob zombie comprise the beginning of the list of music in my head at least for today really like all kinds of music don think music has ever left my life and for that am very thankful it has the capacity to change the coldest heart and calm the troubled mind felt it early on in my soul belive music is language to itself would defend music and its right to be played at any cost shows am into british science fiction shows firefly dr who red dwarf hex supernatural smallville painkiller jane have not watched much else but am enjoying lot of series on netflix very much had weak spot for forever knight and special unit when they first aired food the one thing that cannot even stomach is the combination of broccoli and cheese together just about anything else will work my weakness is all things made from blueberries just cannot pass up anything with them in it the biggest bummer is when they took the blueberry newtons off the market found substitute but they are not the same and to think that blueberries are good for you connections love music serene moments laughter the universe experience has shown me that there is no limit to the repercussion that can happen based on single action it takes but moment to connect in meaningful way it is as if by someone actually reading all of this rambling that they could glean something of my personality and find it within them to craft some witty response to what my mind was going through at this time when all is said and done this sojourn that is life will be what it wanted to be am man of many things it also seems very odd to me to consider writing response to something that obviously by its phrasing at this writing wants single response and not necessarily discourse yet for some reason rather than attempt to write test for this site continue to fill in characters to bring this character total to an acceptable place tell me what you make

my mother was my first best friend and taught me how to be friend along with many other things we remained good friends until she lost her third battle with cancer few years ago when was eleven my family moved from orange county to marin county and had intrastate culture shock which led to series of epiphanies this early philosophical awakening created very intense non conformist who has never stopped questioning everything but never the less loves to have fun learning is fun yes and can always find inner peace dancing we are all co creators of our mutual reality and now is the time to call out the all the bs we have co created to date and begin co creating the world we really want to live in many are already doing this in their our own way we are on the verge of some very great changes brothers and sisters now is not the time to hide and let others make decisions for you everyone has something to contribute large and small many do not even know it yet returning to the mundane studied international relations and economics at university and then worked as an electrician for two decades go figure have two college age daughters not mundane who love very much also love to cook and prefer conversation to consumption finally for those who may find this information important have not had bank account in years and stopped filing paying federal income taxes after the supreme court selected w bush resident in the irs stopped harassing me about four years ago btw federal income taxes on individuals have always been voluntary they just go to great lengths to make you think you are statutorily required to fund their ever more corrupt madness be well and enjoy the day the truth shall set us free love is the only way forward m spiritual being having physical experience life is beautiful ve spent most of the past six years occupying myself with non partisan political activism when wasn dancing now m going to be spending more time dancing while refocusing my activism

photography oh and m refereeing lot of soccer games right now people dancing with ball and the referee gets to change the tune as needed what fun for those of you familiar with the enneagram am with an wing which accounts for the above smile for those of you unfamiliar with the enneagram highly recommend looking into it at the risk of being immodest lot of things ve always been able to do whatever apply myself to especially if it is new different or challenging that said really enjoy anything that has to do with space think this is related to my love of dancing probably my forehead sigh then my smile and my rather unique sense of humor perhaps my legs smile or my curly hair in back bigger smile but but but cut it after decades of having it longish sigh often dress in purple plum and eggplant yes wear purple and be peaceful childhood end by arthur clarke had profound effect on me have read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy many times seem to be reading mostly non

defining how dance on this planet fresh fruit my alto and soprano flutes seriously my family have wonderful family everyone should be as lucky as have been when it comes to family what more does one really need have two college age daughters who rock seriously they love to dance too how can one person be so lucky and still single sigh just about everything we live in very interesting and challenging times think lot about how to get there from here both as an individual and as member of multiple interdependent communities sometimes in the still moments think about you whoever you are and where and when we may find each other kissing you is my preference before after and or while dancing and after we have made very nice dinner together dancing to live music on good floor with room to move hopefully might also be scheduling soccer referees for the weekend if there are still some games to cover and getting ready to referee weekend games myself taking walk after dinner or even

of all the straight guys disgusting one liners when list myself as male label myself bisexual but that only partly true to find out why read further if you installed this script you be able to view my profile properly the script will force okcupid to properly display my gender identity and sexuality at the top of my profile for those of you using the okc app on your smartphones there is link there that you can only see through web browser used to think was woman trapped in man body transsexual but now realize that just want people to treat me differently in the body m in my body isn the problem everybody else perception of it is don identify as either male or female currently define myself as intergendered although the broader terms genderqueer and non binary gender also fit my preferred pronouns are neutral ones they them zi zir or anything similar are all fine m too femme for most straight girls to be romantically and or sexually attracted to me and have the wrong genitals to be enjoyed by lesbians this usually leaves me only able to date bisexual and pansexual people m totally fine with only dating these people only wish there were more of them as they are clear minority at times the limited selection makes my romantic life rather difficult always want to be friends before being lovers do not do one night stands and try my best to avoid potentially short lived relationships that being said most of my friends are polyamorous and so tend to be polyamorish as well date around lot but what m really searching for is relationship that will leave me so satisfied in and of itself that won feel desire to date other people even if still have the option to this is something that know is out there for me just need to find the right person if you think we make good platonic friends don let this last paragraph keep you from writing to me when m in good mood m generally very flirtatious and when do find somebody who m really attracted to have tendency to get really giddy which personally rather enjoy but it does have tendency to make my attraction worry that things are moving too fast it not uncommon for me to be compared to flirtatious school girl m at point in my life where can have sex with anybody solely because find them physically attractive m almost demisexual except m just ignoring primary sexual attraction and only looking for the secondary attraction this is as opposed to not having primary attraction at all like true demisexual would for the definitions of demisexual primary attraction and secondary attraction look here http www asexuality org wiki index php title demisexual back in the day the first thing okc had you fill out was three adjectives that describe you mine are in no particular order queer pragmatic and nurturing hate money with passion there nothing fundamentally wrong with money but the current system is so fucked up that it become merely means of keeping the people currently on top in their places of power m happy making just enough to get by but d be happier with more meaningful job m actively looking in case you noticed that my religion says other and somewhat serious about it and you re wondering about that m unitarian universalist being serious about being uu really doesn involve that much since the main principles of the religion say that you can believe almost anything you want around half of us don even believe in any deity including myself in short m serious about peace love constructive debate constant desire to learn and everybody getting along with everyone else really am feet tall and on the skinny side of average according to oktrends http blog okcupid com index php the biggest lies in online dating most people lie about seemingly harmless little things like their height body condition and income swear to what ever it is that you believe in that have not told even the whitest of lies in my profile if you haven figured it out yet my strategy for creating an online dating profile is to include as much about myself as possible in one believe that boundless honesty is essential in forming the most meaningful relationships and that what m here for so m trying to put as much out front as possible used to act with cincinnati local rocky horror picture show cast the denton affair shadow acting but still lots of fun occasionally think about doing more stage work so far though ve only thought about it rocky horror really aided in my self discovery for anyone that cares am cancer leo cusp my birthday is right smack in between the two and you won find more of cusp than me don really think it matters but some people seem to think this makes me extra awesome so won hold it against you if you do m on the kinsey scale if you assume that m male the kinsey scale doesn work with non binary genders m totally not against cuddling and kissing the right kind of guy but be aware that there will probably be no in pants action going on suppose that this means that am more heteroflexible than bisexual of course the dilemma with this labeling is how can be heteroflexible if don identify as either of the binary genders but have yet to find more suitable label the right kind of guy is by the way more often than not genderqueer and effeminate like myself just moved to the bay from cincinnati simply because it has been my dream to do so for nearly decade knew that if moved out here would finally be free to be myself everyday without fear of ridicule and that my prospects for making would increase after years of saving arrived on april th with no job lined up and only couple of cousins to stay with after many months of searching finally found employment which is slightly gainful which has allowed me to settle in now live in wonderful house in west oakland with five others who are just as queer as am my housemates have become some of my dearest friends and know they re just as happy to have me in their lives as am to have them in mine in the short time ve been in this city ve made more friends than ve ever had before and life is downright wonderful as result in fact dare say that aside from my low wage job ve never been happier recently retook up painting was formally trained with oils for two years in high school painting with oils takes forever but that part of what like about it my art from my teenage years was lost when an ex threw it all in the trash can replace what was lost but m working on new things now would like to go back to school once ve been in the state for year have residency established and thus cheaper tuition rates writing lengthy profiles about myself insert comical drum snare here keeping my cool in tense situations m really good at keeping discussions from turning into arguments even if the other person is irritable m almost always able to help settle disputes between two friends who are too mad at each other to talk otherwise likewise you ll find that no matter how much you scream at me ll never yell back have been known to cry though talking about what going on inside my head this is an especially practical skill for me because apparently my facial expressions can occasionally be very difficult to decipher m also really good at getting other people to talk about what going on inside their own heads m very empathic love to sing and dance m pretty good at both but my singing is definitely better really enjoy going out dancing at clubs so long as they re not too crowded m really good at starting conversations and at breathing new life in to group discussions once they get stale m kind of bad at participating in group discussions though although try m strange like this relatedly m also rather fearless when it comes to talking to strangers especially if they re cute enjoy paying attention to politics and occasionally getting pissed off at our government read and very occasionally watch the news habitually on near daily basis have never lost best two out of three thumb wrestling match used to challenge everyone met but winning got boring this was back in my teens if you think you can beat me ll welcome your contest but am totally serious about never having lost before and cooking not something do every day but it certainly my most practical skill know my way around spice rack pretty darn well or at least like to think so usually when cook it a soup or sauce and it almost always vegetarian or vegan m not vegetarian myself just health conscious usually the very first thing that people notice about me is that m wearing rather femme makeup if my hair is down receive frequent remarks about how long and beautiful it is besides the physical people also notice that have lot of courage often peculiarly accompanied by difficulty in speaking up find it incredibly easy to get on stage or to just walk up to strangers and attempt to start conversations but don always have the easiest time chiming in on ongoing conversations just one of the many ways in which am an oddball feel that should tell you that even though m cooperating and making these lists this is the one section that always skip over when first read somebody profile m confident that can be friends or even lovers with somebody who has different tastes in entertainment sources of knowledge and cuisine than do books hitchhiker guide trilogy celestine prophecy am really here catcher in the rye mysterious stranger brave new world movies moulin rouge the matrix harold and maude benny and joone fantastic planet headwig and the angry inch anything directed by danny boyle or steven spielberg and m always down for documentary music bnl atmosphere all good funk alliance the handsome boy modeling school hilltop hoods mgmt gnarls barkley food pesto pizza golden delicious apples most

and foremost good friends seriously d die long distance communication either phone internet access or even just good old fashioned letter writing d feel lost without at least one of these things nature as in going out and experiencing it thesaurus dictionary almost made the list but use thesaurus far more often love affection cuddles learning the world the human race is in more trouble than we ve ever been in before fascism is vast in asia africa and south america and is spreading in the western world much faster than most people realize or would like to admit the midwest where come from is in horrid police state having escaped it by moving to san francisco is welcome relief racism classism sexism bunch of other negative isms and how might be able to help rid the world of them relationships whether they be platonic sexual or romantic try to stay friends with almost everyone know which is often difficult my mind is full of drama sex think about sex lot and not just me having sex think about the power that sex has over most people about how not nearly enough is done to educate youth about everything around sex and about how so many adults don know everything they should about it either ponder how the relationships have with my friends would be different if we had slept together at some point or if we never slept together but also my sex drive is rather insatiable so do think about myself and sex lot don like the way okc phrased this question because m often working on friday nights instead of telling you what do on fridays ll just tell you what like to do in my free time seeing as how just moved to the bay area and am developing new life this section should be considered work in progress especially because the bulk of it has carried over from my life in cincinnati like to spend most of my time off with other people crave social interaction and only like to spend two or three nights alone each month love to go out and meet new people m down for noisy bar or club but only if it also involves dancing if there no dancing prefer quieter place where people can hear each other when they talk but really love to dance in clubs especially if can find good partner even though like to go out and about many of my evenings are spent in friends living rooms there we converse drink smoke watch movie play game and or make art not that we necessarily ever do all these things at the same time but think you get the point so suppose this section is for confessions well okay have lot of trouble relating to cis males the kinder gentler less sporty ones make this easier though really enjoy looking and acting feminine except for the occasionally feeling shunned by society part moving to the bay has made this lot easier on me though i have lot of love in me to give and that no exaggeration nothing makes me swoon more than when special somebody leans in and kisses me first it only happened twice in my entire life so tend to really cherish the moment when it happens really like sex m actually rather insatiable but only very rarely fantasize about having sex with people who ve never been sexually active with instead my fantasies tend to revolve around flirting and that elusive first kiss that mentioned above yes m this weird even when there nobody around to see it please note that there is no need for you to meet any of the following criteria in order to message me if you re searching for friend you can talk to about anything during all hours of the day with few exceptions this isn something m looking for from lover necessarily but am looking for it from somebody if you ll have the courage to kiss me first it only happened twice in my entire life and m generally rather tired of always having to make the first move if you live somewhere around the bay and want to be my friend if we match or higher in the friend category no matter where you live if you are intergender genderqueer genderfluid or identify as any other kind of non binary gender tend to get along with these people the very best if you ll let me be the little inside spoon despite the fact that m six feet tall if you re new in the bay and want suggestions for things to do in the queer or kinky communities have gained lot of incite in to both since ve been here we don even have to hang out will willingly volunteer this information to you over email because sympathize with being new in town m interested in people who would rather go on picnic on warm sunny day with their best friend than receive the most expensive gift in the world you can not buy happiness ',\n",

impressing potential mate one of my past girlfriends and would go through okcupid and discuss how successful particular profiles were in accomplishing this and what particular subcultures appeared to value in their displays at the hacker dojo occasionally go to bars parties ect because know am supposed to want to go to things like that but don derive any satisfaction from the experience just spend my time watching everyone else get drunk hit on floozies and have fun it not that don like having fun with people just prefer situations in which can have remotely intellectual or risque conversation

at my statistics in general would greatly appreciate it if you would message me however realize that many females and males who use okcupid view any male reaching out to them as deceleration of sexual interest it is not also realize that many individuals only view it worth talking to individual that they intend on attempting to form romantic relationship with or just have sex with if that is why

something in my profile provides valuable hint the funny accent is still there but it fast disappearing admittedly didn exactly come from developing country but had nothing when stepped off the plane except what was stuffed into my suitcases and strong desire to be the best that could be here since m not from around these parts my opinions and humor can be little different to what some may expect also lived in southern california when first came to the us never again and was fortunate or unfortunate enough to live in montana for short period as well when was younger also lived on the island paradise of fiji for few years recent passion has been learning to dance for just over year ve been learning several varieties of ballroom dance including cha cha foxtrot hustle rumba salsa swing tango and waltz if you noticed that those were listed in alphabetical order then top marks to you by day m meek mild manner engineer but at night turn into dancing machine it a great feeling to learn new step and then to actually execute it well with partner who doesn know it coming when m not dancing you may find me playing tennis or squash for those that don know squash may on first appearances look somewhat similar to racquetball except that racquetball absolutely sucks my sense of humor is self deprecating black and like mocking those in authority and those on high moral ground are all fair game there are two philosophies that try to live by give everyone the benefit of the doubt and if your afraid of something confront it and overcome that fear who am looking for don have laundry list the type of person think may be most attracted to is probably positive little adventurous has curious mind and may have been exposed to different cultures during her life bonus points if you can dance double bonus points if you don have clue how to dance but would like to learn learning to dance the smooth dances including the waltz and the foxtrot the latin dances including the rumba salsa tango and cha cha and the rhythm dances including swing and hustle always thought it strange that the hustle is considered latin dance when it is obviously associated most closely with disco music can anyone explain that to me always always trying to maintain that elusive balance between work and pleasure the waltz mediating disagreements word games do you dare challenge me to words with friends pressing buttons my accent my blue eyes and my general all round awesomeness apparently my height m but for some reason people are always commenting that m tall movies shows m movie geek any movie that promotes discovery like contact or mission to mars movies that promote warm fuzzies like radio what great movie movies with good music like xanadu moulin rouge or grease australian movies like starstruck gallipoli mad max and the dish sci fi movies that appeal to my outer not inner nerd like tron dark city blade runner forbidden planet the black hole the andromeda strain logan run event horizon this movie seriously scares the shit out of me dune flash gordon it soooo campy and stargate yes really like sci fi movies movies with explosions movies with horror movies with awesome intro like superman spaghetti westerns like the good the bad and the ugly tv shows with zombies like the walking dead tv shows with educational content which is pretty much anything on the discovery or

perhaps if am lucky one of those could lead to significant relationship figure the first woman meet on here would be perfect how hard can it be mean can see all of the things you consider important you can see all of the things consider important we can see photos of one another clearly nothing can go wrong with this process figure will be engaged by april first so what am looking for in woman intelligence is important don need woman who is rocket scientist but do need you to understand me well enough so that when tell you to do something can be sure it will be understood and executed properly suppose an ivy league degree would give me the necessary confidence that you could do this though would prefer masters degree like women who are attractive believe deserve woman who is attractive used to play lots of sports so used to have fit body and used to have all of my hair so clearly you should have some modeling in your background figure you were probably the spokes model for high end make up line and just to show your versatility you probably modeled swimsuits recently too though in real space am already pretty flexible when it comes to age should probably open it up bit online to help widen my search let say it is always nice if we can share some things in common because used to play sports it would be nice if you also did something maybe you can run marathon in or so well that may not be fair some people are built more for speed or quickness than endurance it only makes sense that would also accept something like an second meter dash or maybe inch vertical leap it would also be nice if we could enjoy watching sports together but don want to have to explain things to you to make sure you know little bit about college football you should be able to tell me the teams of the the bigx or the sec by conference of course ideally you would be able to name all of those but don want to be ridiculous and ask for too much in sf people notice my height but where m from it doesn garner much notice have that clean cut boy next door look actually get comments about it occasionally this is usually not good thing several times have been told you don look like you re from here when have been within blocks of my house people think am tourist or something two of my favorite books are song of the dodo by david quammen and lamb by christopher moore the full title of this is lamb the gospel according to biff christ childhood pal and it is about road trip showing how jesus learned to incorporate other religions buddism hinduism etc into his beliefs while biff tends to focus on things like the kama sutra whether you find this book causing you to laugh out loud or causing steam to rise from your ears will likely depend on how seriously you take your christianity was raised christian so get all the jokes but don take it seriously no longer believer so laugh out loud this caused quite few strange looks as was sitting in the airport however few books have read move so quickly from humorous to profound so be prepared for some emotional whiplash in good way reading david quammen is just fabulously entertaining way to learn about the world in this book you travel the world learning about alfred wallace island biogeography and why what we are doing to manage our wildlife will not likely workand lots of new words music listen to all sorts of things so ll start with my favorite singer songwriters in no particular order peter mulvey martin sexton jeffrey foucault and david wilcox but could also be listening to copland or cantus or take or anthony hamilton or blood sweat and tears or music friends and family food shelter clothing you this profile is still under construction lately have been wondering why so many women have photos of themselves sitting in cars not standing next to their cars not with the door open and the photographer obviously standing outside of the car but in the seat usually with the seat belt on way to be safe ladies and these photos don have their arm showing they are clearly holding the camera themselves what is this all about bored during long commute is it the convienience of the dashboard to put the camera on for self timer photo these women are often pretty dressed up are they on their way out and didn realize they looked so good until they got in the car and thought have to get photo right now m not complaining just don understand it as far as know have never had photo like this taken of me for the record there are also an amazing number of photos taken in public bathrooms but let tackle one mystery at time still think about sailing or motorcycle trips but lately it been more about car photos m optimistic enough that always buy tickets for upcoming concerts etc even if don know who will be taking wanted to mention this since my age range always raises questions and it is in the section just above don care about age want to be intellectually emotionally and physically attracted to someone date obviously there are patterns to those attractions but that is it know this is the kind of thing that is said lot online but actually started saying this in college before
